***Don't google them, use my app instead!*** 

Choose your favourite hero from the list:

The app will remind you not only how this hero looks..

... but also how their voice sounds! 
Just press the red "PLAY" button on the bottom of a screen and you will hear a funny phrase by that character! 


Share the photo of your hero on social media or simply download it to your Photo Library using Share Sheet.

Works on both iPhone and iPad!
